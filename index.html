            <h3>
                Wyatt, I hope you have a wonderful birthday. I am so proud of the young man you are becoming. I enjoy watching football with you, playing sports, reading books, and wrestle-dome/couch game. I look forward to the future adventures we have together, and I want to thank you for being a great friend. 
                <br><br>
                For your birthday (as requested), we are going to go have some fun in the snow. With this page, you have one free snowboard rental at Beech Mountain Resort. Please ask your parents for a good weekend for us to drive up to the mountain. The drive takes about 3 hours, so bring snacks! Can't wait to share snowboarding with you. 
            </h3>
